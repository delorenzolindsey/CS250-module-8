Sprint Review and Retrospective from class project


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

To interpet user needs is to try and understand what the user's end goal is. If a product owner can understand what the customer will need and the features it takes to reach that goal. Then they can communite that with the scrum team correctly to be implemented into the program.
User stories similifies these features needed and creates a more list of required features and the priority of each feature. These User stories help the development team full understand what is needed of them. Thius allows for the development team to fully create what the client needs.

How so I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to similfy what is needed and start from there. Create the bare needs of the features then after they can be edited to fit the program itself. 
If I need to make a button that opens a page then focus on creating the button thta correctly opens the link not the pretty details on the link itself. The main features are the focus.
I hope to implent the contunuous adaptive change successfully and to be able to to naturely prioritize the correfct process for the short release cycles. I wish to be able to learn and improve constantly like a true scrum team would.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in any team is one that focuses on their product and communicates efficiently. A good team members understand what the task require of them is and if they do not communicates to learn what is needed. They can organize their portion of work. They need to request positive and negative feedback to learn from for thier work to continue to be efficient.


Thank you for your time.
